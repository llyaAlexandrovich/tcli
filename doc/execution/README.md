# Tcli execution process eplanation  



# Overview  

## Tcli claims to be secure and reliable and therefore tries to put YOU in the first place. This means NO EXTERNAL SERVICES ARE REQUIRED while using TCli. TCli will only connect to Telegram© servers. No additional services at all. No metrics. No telemetry. Nothing that you don't like.  
  
  
# Internal security methods

1. 3WV - 3 Way-Verification  
    This method is the key feature inside the TCli. 3WV executes every time you open the program, and verify that program itself, configs that program desire to use, environment and operating system are valid and not compromised. This feature is fully described in doc/security/3WV/README.md .
